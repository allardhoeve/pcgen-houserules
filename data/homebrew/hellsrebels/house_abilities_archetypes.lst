Blessing of Prosperity	KEY:Oath of Labor ~ Blessing of Prosperity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Features.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A paladin that swears an oath of labor is a patron of wealth and seeks to even the playing field for those who have unfair economic disadvantages. By expending a use of lay on hands, the paladin can instead grant a blessing to herself or a creature touched as a standard action. A blessing of prosperity lasts up to 1 hour, though the paladin who bestowed it can end a blessingâ€™s benefits early (whether it affects her or another creature) as a free action. A character who has benefited from a blessing of prosperity cannot benefit from such a blessing again for 24 hours. When using this ability, the paladin chooses one of two blessings: Either the target gains a +4 sacred bonus on Craft, Perform, and Profession checks or the target gains a +4 sacred bonus on Appraise and Sense Motive checks. This replaces the mercy gained at 3rd level.
Code of Conduct				KEY:Oath of Labor ~ Code of Conduct	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Features.SpecialQuality								DESC:All creatures are inherently equal, and those that deny this fact for their own gain do the common man harm.  A struggle is meaningless if it is not done together for a greater purpose than oneself. Stand and fight with your brothers and sisters for the betterment of all.  Give respect, love and kindness to the disenfranchised that find themselves without any. They are your comrades and the reason you fight.  The world must change if it is to be better, and it will not change if we do not act. Do your part to make a more just future. You are not above the work that the common man does. Whenever you have the chance, labor with them as they do and work to ease their difficult lot in life.	SOURCEPAGE:p.61
